    "bio":" When I first went to college in 2011,It was an institute call ICPR Junior College that prepares you for the CompTIA A+ exams,the computer technician certification. That's where my passion started to grow. Once I saw that, I have the skill of learning things quickly. I decided to take one step further, the IT field has always been my passion. Having a background as a computer hardware and repair technician, I started to get  interested in coding.Then I said to my self you need to get to the other level. So I went to the University of Pennsylvania coding Bootcamp where I became a Full-Stack Web  Developer. I consider my self a team player having experience working with different teams in different types of roles and backgrounds. ",
